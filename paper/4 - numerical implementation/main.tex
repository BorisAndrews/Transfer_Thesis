    \BA{Perhaps the best way to do this would be to create a table of all the different software options available ({\tt Firedrake} [Firedrake emoji]/{\tt Nektar++}/{\tt deal.ii}/bespoke) vs. the presence/difficulty of implementation of all the different features I'd like (for each of the different non-Maxwellian correction modelling techniques too).}

    \BA{Why {\tt Firedrake} [Firedrake emoji]?:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  {\tt PETSc} integration allows (comparitively) easy implementation of the preconditioner.
        \item  Open source nature.
        \item  Some support for the fluid/PIC integration in {\tt DMSWARM} in {\tt PETSc}. (Will Saunders has concerns about the way particles are passed between MPI ranks- the particles are distributed from one rank to \emph{all possible receiving ranks} — computationally intense already! — then has no checks for existence and uniqueness for a receiving rank. Apparently solving this would be a parallelisation nightmare too.)
        \item  {\tt Firedrake} [Firedrake emoji] has {\tt DefCon}.
        \item  Ask Patrick.
    \end{itemize}}

    \BA{Why \emph{not} {\tt Firedrake} [Firedrake emoji]?:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  No support for meshes of dimension $> 3$ at the moment, if I went down the route of simulating the non-Maxwellian correction through a \emph{kinetic} model.
        \item  Some of the fluid/PIC integration is well-implemented within the ExCALIBUR NEPTUNE project in {\tt NESO} (\href{https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO}{link}), {\tt NESO-Particles} (\href{https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-Particles}{link}) and {\tt NESO-Spack} (\href{https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-Spack}{link}) within {\tt Nektar++}- works on GPUs and everything!
        \item  Ask Patrick.
    \end{itemize}}
