\section{Coupled Fluid/Correction Models: A \emph{Low} Collisionality Concept}
    \BA{How we can re-adapt the techniques that traditionally give a fluid model when the collision operator is non-dominant to get an accurate fluid model, to apply modern techniques in fluid simulation?}
    
    \BA{Expand as a sum of a Maxwellian and some correction!}
    
    \subsubsection*{Fluid Background: A \emph{Fluid} Model}
        \BA{Ideas already well-developed!}
        
        \BA{Correction contribution not too problematic (hopefully).}
        
    \subsubsection*{Non-Maxwellian Correction: A \emph{Kinetic} Model}
        \BA{Not just kicking the problem down the road- plasma is thermalised/Maxwellian in ``most places'' for ``most physically relevant simulations'', so the correction is (compartively) small in ``most places''.}
        
        \BA{How do we model this:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Lattice Boltzmann?
            \item  Some series expansion?
            \item  Particle-in-cell (PIC)? One thing worthy of note that I'm concerned about is how a PIC model would handle different tail behaviours for very-high-energy particles. In tozmahok plasmas for example, Alfvénic damping of particles with velocities above the Alfvén velocity causes particle energy distributions to have a cut-off that is $\ll  \exp\left(- {\rm const.}\|\bfv\|^2\right)$ as $\|\bfv\|  \rightarrow  \infty$ (see figure \ref{sharp cut-off energy distributions}). Salomon seems to believe this has a strong effect on the plasma behaviour, and things Wayne has said would hint in this direction too. Honestly I think the response to this is just to ensure the particles are generated with enough fidelity on the tails to capture these varying behaviours, and otherwise not worry about it, unless the people at Warwick have any better suggestions? I mean honestly, how much can I do about this? Would need to understand the theory a little better first.
