\section{Coupled Fluid/Correction Models: A \emph{Low} Collisionality Concept}
    \BA{How we can re-adapt the techniques that traditionally give a fluid model when the collision operator is non-dominant to get an accurate fluid model, to apply modern techniques in fluid simulation?}
    
    \BA{Expand as a sum of a Maxwellian and some correction!}
    
    \subsubsection*{Fluid Background: A \emph{Fluid} Model}
        \BA{Ideas already well-developed!}
        
        \BA{Correction contribution not too problematic (hopefully).}
        
    \subsubsection*{Non-Maxwellian Correction: A \emph{Kinetic} Model}
        \BA{Not just kicking the problem down the road- plasma is thermalised/Maxwellian in ``most places'' for ``most physically relevant simulations'', so the correction is (compartively) small in ``most places''.}
        
        \BA{How do we model this:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Lattice Boltzmann?
            \item  Some series expansion?
            \item  Particle-in-cell (PIC)?
        \end{itemize}}
