\section{Edge Plasma Model}
    \BA{Little about the edge plasma model we're going to consider:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Looking for symmetric structures on a low aspect ratio?
        \item  Idk there's a lot of ways to consider this- I could very well end up doing different kinds of simulations with all different kinds of BCs in the final product, and seeing how my results match up.
    \end{itemize}}
