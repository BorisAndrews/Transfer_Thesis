\subsection{Tokamak Plasmas}
    \BA{Why the fluid/MHD model reductions aren't necessarily valid in tokamak plasmas. (Incorrectly assumed dominant collisional term- get some estimates on the scale of these terms in the edge plasma. Good content under ``Mathematical Descriptions'' \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)}{here}.)}
    
    \BA{Many effects not captured my MHD/2 fluid models (check out \href{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/A_Comparison_Chart_For_Modeling_Plasma2.png}{this} diagram off Wikipedia, or again the content under ``Mathematical Descriptions'' \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)}{here}.):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Most plasma waves
        \item  Most plasma/kinetic instabilities
        \item  Landau damping/bump-on-tail instability
        \item  Leakage
        \item  Structures (Beams/Double layers)
        \item  Anisotropic pressures
    \end{itemize}}
    
    \BA{The resultant kinetic PDE. (Boltzmann/Vlasov equations.)}
    
    \BA{Talk about gyrokinetic model:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The model's physical basis/mathematics. (Equations provide good insight into the origin of some behavioural effects, e.g. gyro-orbits/drifts.)
        \item  Why we don't use it on the general kinetic equation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  High mathematical (more terms in lower dimensions doesn't necessarily mean faster computation)/computational (really don't want to do a 5D simulation) complexity.
            \item  Errors from neglection of terms. (Non-physical behaviour over long times/resonances and adiabatic invariants can be lost.)
        \end{itemize}
        \item  We \emph{will} however use it for the PIC correction.
    \end{itemize}}
