\chapter{Bifurcation Analysis}
    \BA{Introduction.}

    \BA{Lots to be said about the search for symmetry and ill-posedness here.}

    \BA{Also worthy of note is the fact that the way I handle the PIC side could end up being non-deterministic, which would maybe mess up the deflation algorithm. (Maybe use some kind of deterministic seed- I could run the bifurcation analysis a few times with different seeds, and compare the results?)}
