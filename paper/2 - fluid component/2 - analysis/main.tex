    Suppose each of the following functions lies in the following function space:\footnote{$\bftau$ is not included here, as it is included only as a notational shortcut, not as a variable to solve for in and of itself.} \BA{(Very tough to pick good notation here... Would be nice if there were some convention.)}
    \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{ c || c : c c : c c | c | c c }
        Function  &  $\rho$  &  $\bfp$  &  $\bfu$  &  $p$  &  $\theta$ 
         &  $\bfj$  &  $\bfE$  &  $\bfB$  \\
        \hline
        Function space  &  $\bbD$  &  $\bbM$  &  $\bbU$  &  $\bbP$  &  $\bbtheta$  &  $\bbJ$  &  $\bbE$  &  $\bbB$  \\
    \end{tabular}\end{center}
