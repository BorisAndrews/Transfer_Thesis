\subsection{Variational Formulation and Well-Posedness}
    \BA{Introduction.}
    
    To apply the finite element method, one must first cast the model (\ref{eqn:current identity}â€“\ref{eqn:Gauss's law}) into a chosen variational form, by asserting that its inner product, in this case under the $L^{2}$ norm, is equal to $0$ upon integration by all function in some chosen function space, in this case ones derived from $\calD$, $\cdots$, $\calB$.
